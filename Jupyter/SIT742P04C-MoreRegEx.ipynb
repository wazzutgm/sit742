For example, the [common string operations](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html) built in Python. \n","However, these methods are limited to simplest cases. For example, the `string.find()` method in Python \n","returns the lowest index of the matched substring in a given string.\n","In more complex cases, such as data validation, where you are going to test an string to see if a telephone number pattern occurs within the string, it could result in code containing a stack of \n","`if` statements by using different Python's built-in string functions.\n","To simplify the code and make it more readable, you might need to move up to [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). So what is a regular expression?\n","\n","> \"A regular expression is a pattern which specifies a set of strings of characters; it is said to match certain strings.\"--- Ken Thompson\n","\n","If you've ever typed `cp *.ipynb ../module_2/` at the UNIX command prompt, or entered \"match?\" into a web-based search engine, you've already used a simple regular expression. In the first instance, you've copied all the files which end with file extension \".ipynb\" (as opposed to copying them one by one); in the second, you've conducted a search not only for \"match,\" but also for \"matches\", \"matching\", \"matched\", and \"matcher\" all at once.\n","Using a well-crafted regular expression, you can easily search through a large number of text files, searching for words ending with \"ed\", replace the .html suffix with a .xml suffix, and then change all the lower case characters to upper case. \n","\n","Regular expressions (Regex) are all about matching and finding patterns in text, from simple patterns to the very complex ones.\n","For instance, they can be simple as this:\n","```python\n","    \\d\n","```\n","A character shorthand that matches any digit from 0 to 9.\n","They can also be something a bit more complicated like \n","```python\n","(19|20)\\d\\d[- /.](0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\n","```\n","which is where we will wind up at the end of this chapter: a fairly robust regular expression\n","that matches a date in yyyy-mm-dd format from between 1900-01-01 and 2099-12-31, with a choice of four separators, which are '-', ' ', '/' and '.'.

Regular Expressions\n","\n","As a powerful way of searching, replacing, and parsing text with complex patterns of characters, regular expressions are the most significant tools in data parsing. They figure into all kinds of text-manipulation tasks. Searching and search-and-replace are among the most common uses. Regular expressions tend to be easier to write than they are to read. This is less of a problem if you are the only one who ever needs to maintain them. But if several people need to, the syntax can turn into more of a hindrance than an aid. For example,\n","```python\n","    ^(|(([A-Za-z0-9]+_+)|([A-Za-z0-9]+\\-+)|([A-Za-z0-9]+\\.+)|([A-Za-z0-9]+\\++))*[A-Za-z0-9]+@((\\w+\\-+)|(\\w+\\.))*\\w{1,63}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6})$\n","```\n","is a regular expression for validating email addresses.\n","Please don't try to parse it yourself, \n","since an experienced regular expression user might take a while to parse it.\n","In this section, we will first go through some good introductory materials of regular expressions,\n","and then show you some fundamentals of how to use regular expressions in search text.\n","\n","There are a couple of good online materials that introduce regular expressions in Python. \n","We strongly suggest that you study this chapter together with these materials. \n","They are \n","* [Regular Expression HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3.8/howto/regex.html) from Python's office website: An introductory tutorial to using regular expressions in Python with the `re` module. ðŸ“–\n","* [Regular Expressions](https://www.deakin.edu.au/library), chapter 5 of \"**Dive into Python 3**\": A series of examples inspired by real world problems are used to show you how to generate regular expressions for parsing street name, Roman numerals, and phone numbers. ðŸ“–\n","\n","The complete list of meta-characters and their behaviour in the context of regular expressions can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/re.html).

Summary\n","\n","This chapter has discussed the fundamentals of regular expressions.\n","You have learnt how to develop regular expressions for handling street addresses, Roman numerals, phone numbers, and dates. Regular expressions may not be suitable for dealing with complex XML files but the basic idea that a regular expression can block anything that doesn't match is both useful and powerful. You might use regular expressions, for example, as the basis for a short program that filters incoming spam in your email. In this case, the program might use a regular expression to determine whether the name of a known spammer appeared in the \"From:\" line of the email. Email filtering programs, in fact, very often use regular expressions for exactly this type of operation. You will further learn regular expressions in Module 6 on text pre-processing. It is worth noting that regular expressions are not specific to Python. Many other programming languages also provide regular expression capabilities, for example, Perl, Java, Ruby, etc. Finally, do you think it's possibly to do Data Wrangling without regular expressions?\n","\n","---\n","\n","Watch the Software Carpentry lecture on regular expressions, if you need more helps.\n","\n","https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7C1EB31127AB8A0B\n","\n","- - -\n","\n","## Part 5.
