Counting Vocabulary by Selecting Tokens of Interest\n","\n","Two important concepts that should be mentioned first are **type** and **token**.\n","Here are the definitions of the two terms, quoted from \"[tokenization](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html)\",  \n",">a **token** is an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing;\n","\n","> a **type** is the class of all tokens containing the same character sequence. \n","\n","A *type* is also a vocabulary entry. In other words, a vocabulary consists of a number of word types.\n","The distinction between a type and its tokens is a distinction that separates a descriptive concept from\n","its particular concrete instances. \n","This is quite similar to the distinction in object-oriented programming between classes and objects.\n","In this section, you are going to learn how to count types in a given corpus by further processing the text.\n","\n","The document collection that we are going to use is a set of Reuters articles that comes with NLTK.\n","It contains 10788 Reuters articles in total and has been split into two subsets, training and testing.\n","Although this collection has already been pre-processed (e.g., you can access the text at different levels, like raw text, tokens, and sentences),\n","we would still like to demonstrate how to put some of the basis text preprocessing steps together and process the raw Reuters articles step by step.\n","First, import the main Python libraries."]},{"metadata":{"id":"7WLSkQVfWLox","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["#matplotlib package is used for Data virtualization\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline \n","\n","#nltk.tokenize.punkt module. \n","#This tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences by using an unsupervised algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words, collocations, and words that start sentences. \n","#It must be trained on a large collection of plaintext in the target language before it can be used.\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.corpus import reuters\n","nltk.download('punkt')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"IkNQeE9rWLoz","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Since the tokenizer works on a per document level, we can parallelize the process of tokenization with Python's multi-processing module.
