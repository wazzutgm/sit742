Reading Materials\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","The majority of text data that appears in everyday sources such as books, \n","newspapers, magazines, emails, blogs, and tweets \n","is free language text. Given the amount of information stored as text on the Internet, it is not feasible for a human to manually explore such a large amount of text data to extract useful information. Therefore, we have to use automatic approaches, such as text analysis algorithms developed in the fields of text mining, natural language process (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). It is worth knowing that computers cannot directly understand text like humans. For example, humans can automatically break down sentences into units of meaning, but computers cannot. Therefore, text data must be processed before various text analysis algorithms can use it.\n","\n","Unlike the data you can retrieve from relational databases, text data always appears in an unstructured form.\n","By unstructured we mean that text data exists \"in the wild\" and has not been converted into a structured format, like a spreadsheet. Therefore, it has to be manipulated and converted into a proper structured and numerical format consumable by text analysis algorithms, which is referred to as text pre-processing. It is an important task and a critical step in text analysis. The characters, words and sentences identified by text pre-processing are the fundamental units passed to all the downstream text analysis algorithms, such as part-of-speech tagging, parsing, document classification and clustering, etc.\n","This chapter describes the basic pre-processing steps that are needed to convert unstructured text into a structured \n","format."]},{"metadata":{"id":"et29QNJy6a7X","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 1. Accessing Various Text Resources\n","\n","What are the text corpora and lexical resources often used in text analysis? Where and how can we \n","access them? \n","Text data used for different text analysis tasks can be derived from various resources, such as \n","* **Existing data repositories**, most of which contains corpora that have been either pre-processed into a specific format that can be directly digested by the downstream text analysis algorithms or manually annotated. \n","For example,\n","    *  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=text&sort=nameUp&view=table) contains 30 corpora that can be used in text mining tasks, such as regression, clustering, and classification.  \n","    * [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/) contains corpora mainly used in various natural language processing tasks, such as parsing, acoustic analysis, phonological analysis and etc. One disadvantage of using LDC is that its corpora are not free. Users have to buy a license in order to use those corpora.\n","    \n","* **NLTK**: A language toolkit that also includes a diverse set of corpora and lexical resources, which include, for example,\n","    * Plain text corpora, e.g.,\n","        * The Gutenberg Corpus contains thousands of books.\n","    * Tagged Corpora, e.g.,\n","        * The Brown Corpus is annotated with part-of-speech tags. Each word is now paired with its part-of-speech tag.\n","           You can retrieve words as (word, tag) tuples, rather than just bare word strings.\n","    * Chunked Corpora, e.g.,\n","        * The CoNLL corpora includes phrasal chunks (CoNLL 2000), named entity chunks (CoNLL 2002).\n","    * Parsed Corpora, e.g.,\n","        * The Treebank corpora provide a syntactic parse for each sentence, like the Penn Treebank based on Wall Street Journal samples.\n","    * Word List and Lexicons, e.g.,\n","        * [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/): a large lexical database of English, where nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized into interlinked synsets (i.e., sets of synonyms)\n","    * Categorized Corpora: \n","        * The Reuters corpus: a corpus of Reuters News stories for used in developing text analysis algorithms.\n","        \n","* **Web**: The largest source for getting text data is the Web. Text can be extracted from webpages or be retrieved\n","via various APIs. For example,\n","     * **Wikipedia articles**: The Wikimedia website provides links to download dumps of Wikipedia articles. Click [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki) to view various dumps for English Wikipedia articles. \n","     * **Tweets** that allows people to communicate with short, 140-characters messages. It is fortunate that Twitter provides quite well documented API that we can use to retrieve tweets of our interest.\n","     * The other text data can be scraped from the Internet, like webpages. Here is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xQTJi2tqgk\">Youtube video</a> on **scraping websites with Python**.\n","\n","The set of NLTK corpora can be easily accessed with interfaces offered by NLTK.

The hyphen can be used to form certain compound terms, including hyphenated compound nouns, verbs and adjectives. It can also be used for word division. There are many sources of hyphens in texts. Thus, should one count a sequence of letters with a hyphen as one word to two? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be sometimes one, sometimes two. \n","For example, if the hyphen is used to split up vowels in words, such as \"co-operate\", \"co-education\" and \"pre-process\", these words should be regarded as single token. In contrast, if the hyphen is used to group a couple of words together, for example, \"a state-of-the-art algorithm\" and \"a money-back guarantee\", these hyphenated words should be separated into individual words.\n","Therefore, handling hyphenated words automatically is one of the most difficult tasks in pre-processing text data.\n","\n","\"**The Art of Tokenization**\" (Please refer the Part 4, Reading Materials) categorizes different hyphens into three types:\n","* **End-of-Line Hyphen**: In professionally printed material (like books, and newspapers), the hyphen is used to divide words between the end of one line and the beginning of the next in order to perform justification of text during typesetting. It seems to be easy to handle these kinds of hyphens by simply removing them and joining the parts of a word at the end of one line and the beginning of the next.\n","* **Lexical Hyphen**: Words with a lexical hyphen are better to be treated as a single word. They are typically included in a dictionary. For example, words contains certain prefixes, like \"co-\", \"pre-\", \"multi-\", etc., and other words like \"so-called\", \"forty-two\"\n","* **Sententially Determined Hyphenation**: This type of hyphen is often created dynamically. It includes, for example, nouns modified by an 'ed'-verb (e.g., \"text-based\" and \"hand-made\") and sequences of words used as a modifier in a noun group, as in \"the 50-cent-an-hour raise\". In these cases, we might want to treat those tokens joined by hyphens as individual words.\n","\n","The use of hyphens in many such cases is extremely inconsistent, which further increase the complexity of dealing with hyphens in tokenization. People often resort to using either some heuristic rules or treating it as a machine learning problem. However, these go beyond our scope here. It is clear that handling hyphenation is much more complicated than one can expect. You should also be clear that there is no way of handling all the cases above.\n","\n","Let's assume that we are going to treat all strings of two words separated by a hyphen as a single token, how can we extract them from texts without breaking them into pieces.

Often natural language processing tools require their input to be divided into sentences for a number of reasons. However sentence boundary identification is challenging because punctuation marks are often ambiguous. For example, a period may denote an abbreviation, decimal point, an ellipsis, or an email address - not the end of a sentence. About 47% of the periods in the Wall Street Journal corpus denote abbreviations. As well, question marks and exclamation marks may appear in embedded quotations, emoticons, computer code, and slang.\n","\n","SBD is one of the essential problems for many NLP tasks, like Parsing, Information Extraction, Machine Translation, and Document Summarizations. \n","The accuracy of the SBD system will directly affect the performance of these applications. \n","\n","Sentences are the basic textual unit immediately above the word and phrase. \n","So what is a sentence?
