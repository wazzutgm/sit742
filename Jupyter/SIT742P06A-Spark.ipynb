However, many datasets today are too large to be stored on a single computer, and even when a dataset can be stored on one computer (such as the datasets in this tutorial), the dataset can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.  Spark has efficient implementations of a number of transformations and actions that can be composed together to perform data processing and analysis.  Spark excels at distributing these operations across a cluster while abstracting away many of the underlying implementation details. Spark has been designed with a focus on scalability and efficiency. With Spark you can begin developing your solution on your laptop, using a small dataset, and then use that same code to process terabytes or even petabytes across a distributed cluster.\n","\n","The following transformations will be covered:\n","*  `map()`, `mapPartitions()`, `mapPartitionsWithIndex()`, `filter()`, `flatMap()`, `reduceByKey()`, `groupByKey()`\n"," \n","The following actions will be covered:\n","*  `first()`, `take()`, `takeSample()`, `takeOrdered()`, `collect()`, `count()`, `countByValue()`, `reduce()`, `top()`\n"," \n","Also covered:\n","*  `cache()`, `unpersist()`, `id()`, `setName()`\n"," \n","Note that, for reference, you can look up the details of these methods in [Spark's Python API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD)\n","\n","After that you will test that the virtual machine (VM) is functioning properly.\n","\n","You will not need to solve any problems to complete this lab.

One task is launched for each partitition, as shown in the example below.  A task is a unit of execution that runs on a single machine.
